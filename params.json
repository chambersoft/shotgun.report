{"name":"shotgun.report","tagline":"The kayak.com of consumer complaints.","body":"# mission\r\n\r\n*shotgun.report* takes aim at businesses who harbor **unethical practices** and empowers consumers to fill out one report which will get submitted through the better business bureau, ripoffreport.com, and other media outlets. Businesses often have legal counsel and unethical contracts and fine print to ensure that customers complaints (legal / ethical) are heavily slanted in their favor. It is becoming increasingly more difficult for customers to be heard. Shotgun.report puts the power back in the hands of the consumer, allowing them to fill out a single complaint that will get maximum attention.\r\n\r\n# roadmap\r\n\r\nshotgun.report is still a work in progress.  Please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/chambersoft/shotgun.report/issues) or email [cole.chamberlain@gmail.com](mailto:cole.chamberlain@gmail.com) if you have any requests or something to discuss.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n&copy; 2015 chambersoft.io","google":"UA-56916319-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
